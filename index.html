  <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
  <p>
   CI/CD is like having a digital safety net for your team. Instead of manually checking every line of code, 
   Continuous Integration automatically catches mistakes the moment they’re made. Then, 
   Continuous Deployment takes the stress out of updates by smoothly delivering them to your users.
   It turns the chaotic "launch day" into a quiet, reliable process,
   giving developers more time to create and less time to fix broken things.

  <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
  <p>
    When I push my code to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically starts.
    It checks if all required files exist, then uploads the website files.
    After that, the workflow deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
    Finally, the website becomes live and updated automatically.
