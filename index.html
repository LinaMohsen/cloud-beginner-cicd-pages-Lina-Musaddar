  <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
  <p>
    CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
    Continuous Integration means automatically testing and checking the code
    every time developers push changes. Continuous Deployment means automatically
    releasing the updated application to users. CI/CD helps reduce errors,
    save time, and make software delivery faster and more reliable.

  <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
  <p>
    When I push my code to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically starts.
    It checks if all required files exist, then uploads the website files.
    After that, the workflow deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
    Finally, the website becomes live and updated automatically.
