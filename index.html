      <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
      <p>
        CI/CD is a modern software development practice that automates the process of integrating and deploying code.
        Instead of manually reviewing every change, Continuous Integration automatically tests and checks the code whenever it is updated.
        Continuous Deployment then ensures that successful changes are delivered to users quickly and smoothly.
        Rather than relying on stressful, large release days, updates happen gradually and reliably.
        This approach improves software quality, reduces errors, and allows developers to focus more on building new features instead of fixing unexpected problems.

      <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        In my project, the pipeline is automatically triggered whenever I push changes to the main branch.
        GitHub Actions starts by checking out the repository and verifying that all required files, such as index.html, style.css, and script.js, exist.
        If the checks pass successfully, the workflow uploads the website files as an artifact for deployment.
        In the next stage, the deployment job publishes the website to GitHub Pages.
        As a result, every change I make is automatically tested and deployed, ensuring a reliable and fully automated update process.
