# Cloud Beginner CI/CD with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages

## My Information
Name: Lina Al Musaddar  
Course: Cloud Computing  

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically runs a workflow that:
1. Checks required website files
2. Uploads the website content
3. Deploys the site to GitHub Pages
This ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment.
